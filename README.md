I do read AL's feedback channel, so if you have an interesting suggestion you can DM `pi.kt` on discord.

## Documentation

* [Chat commands](docs/chat_commands.md)
* [Configuration](docs/configuration.md)

## Requirements:
* Python with f-string support
* `java` in path
* Android Studio with the following components installed and in `PATH`:
  * NDK: for `ndk-build[.cmd]`
  * Android SDK: for `zipalign[.exe]` and `apksigner[.bat]`

## Usage
```
$ python perseus.py --help
usage: perseus apk builder [-h] [--skip | --no-skip] [--quick-rebuild | --no-quick-rebuild] [--clean | --no-clean]

builds apk for you (this is the default behaviour if called with no arguments)

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --skip, --no-skip     skip decompile and extracting if possible
  --quick-rebuild, --no-quick-rebuild
                        rebuild apk by replacing libs in the apk instead of using apktool (saves 40s)
  --clean, --no-clean   delete built apk, decompiled sources, compiled perseus libs and xapk
```

The first build takes 3 to 5 minutes, subsequent builds take 15-20 seconds.

If the built APK doesn't work for you and you're on Windows, try running the script inside Git Bash/MSYS.
