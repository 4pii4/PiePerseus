Herein lies the awful source code used to build the libraries found in the master branch (albeit with some minor, unimportant changes).

As stated in the main branch's README, the project won't be maintained or updated from this point on. With that in mind, alongside the fact there are other methods to modify the game, I believe the soundest choice is to release the source code for the community to use.

The method used to interact with the Lua backend provides complete control over the game's code. Thus, more elaborate, high-quality modifications than the ones included can be easily achieved with a bit of creativity.

Feel free to fork the repo or open pull requests.

PS: Don't judge the code too harshly, for I already do so myself. I have written a better version from scratch, but it's merely a silly pastime of mine.
